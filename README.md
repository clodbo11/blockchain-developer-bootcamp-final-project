## Project Ideas

**Blockchain-based Voting System**:Electronic voting systems have replaced paper-based systems, but even now, people doubt the voting system’s ability to secure the data and defend against any attacks. The blockchain-based system can ensure transparent and publicly verifiable elections in the country.

**Transparent Charity Application**:Most people want to donate money to a good cause of charity, but they are unsure if the money is going to reach the right hands of the destitute.  The blockchain system can bring transparency to online charity trusts. Contributors can see the journey of the donation in realtime and confirm if it’s reaching the deserving hands or not.


**Peer-to-Peer Lending**:Create a P2P lending platform that connects investors and lenders.
